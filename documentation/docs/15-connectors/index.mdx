<RepoBadges artifact="connectors" />

## Description

All REST and Websocket connectors in one place.

## Installation

<ArtifactInstall repo="connectors" />

## Instantiation

The `Conectors` class is the entry point of every client. It receives the API keys at instantiation.

```java
Connectors connectors = new Connectors(key, secret);
```

## REST connectors

### Calling a client

Clients are singletons and are lazy loaded, meaning it will be instantiated on demand and will then always return the same instance of the client.

```java
// First call, the client is instantiated.
connectors.rest().market().getServerTime().sync();
// Second call, the same instance is returned.
connectors.rest().market().getBookTicker().sync();
```

### Updating the API keys

Every time you call a client, it will check if its keys are equal to the container keys and update them if not. This feature is useful if you manage multiple API keys.

```java
//Updating keys in the container
connectors.rest().updateKeys(key,secret);

//keys have changed, they are updated in the client when it is called
connectors.rest().spot();

//keys haven't changed, nothing happens
connectors.rest().spot();
```

## Websocket connectors

Like REST clients, Websoket clients are Singletons.

### Clients watching specific symbols

Every instance will be attached to it's symbol(s).

```java
// First call, the client is instantiated.
connectors.ws().bookTicker("BNBBTC,BTCBUSD,CAKEBUSD", callback).open();

// To get the client, call it by its symbol. Every client is wrapped by an Optional object.
Optional<WebsocketBookTickerClient> client = connectors.ws().bookTicker("BNBBTC,BTCBUSD,CAKEBUSD");

//Check if client is not null and close it
if(client.isPresent()){
    client.get().close();
}
```

:::caution
Defining a new client on the same symbols will overwrite the previous one.

### Clients watching all symbols

Clients watching all symbols are called without argument:

```java
connectors.ws().allBookTickers(callback).open();

connectors.ws().allBookTickers().get();
```

### User data client

User data client is linked by its ListenKey:

```java
WebsocketUserDataClient client = connectors.ws().user(callback);
key : String = client.getListenKey();

client.open();

connectors.ws().user(key).get();
```
