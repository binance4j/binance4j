import Examples from "@site/src/components/v2/ApiExamples";

## Client instantiation

Every `RestClient` require an `API key` and a `SECRET key` in their constructor except for `SpotVisionClient` where every data is public.

```java
MarketClient client = new MarketClient(key, secret);
```

## Send a request

RestClient's methods don't make API calls, they return an instance of a `Request` able to make sync and async calls.

```java
var req = client.getExchangeInfo();

//sync

try{
    var res = req.sync();
}catch(ApiException e){
    //...
}

// async

req.async((res, e)->{
    if(e != null){
        ///...
    }
});

```

## Exception handling

Any error will throw an `ApiException`. Sync calls must be wrapped in a try catch and async calls return an ApiException in the callback.

<Examples payload="ExchangeInfo" method="getExchangeInfo" items={[{ label: "All symbols" }]} />

## Accessing headers

You can access the response headers by adding them as second parameter in the callback of an async call/

```java
client.getExchangeInfo().async((response, headers, exception) -> {
    if(exception == null){
        //...
    }else{
        //...
    }
});
```

## Rate limiting

Rate limiting is enabled by default. Your first REST request will fetch the API rate limits and instantiate two limiters: one for the raw request limits and one for the request weight limits. It will then start a one second interval when exceeding the period limit will make the current thread sleep for the remaining time before the next one second period.

If you want to disable rate limiting:

```java
RateLimiting.disable();
```

To enable rate limiting:

```java
RateLimiting.enable();
```

To check rate limiting state:

```java
RateLimiting.isEnabled();
```
