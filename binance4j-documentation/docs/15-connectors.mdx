## Description

All Binance4j REST clients in one place.

## Installation

<ArtifactInstall repo="connectors" />

## Connectors class

The `Conectors` class is the entry point of every client. It receives the API keys at instantiation.

```java
Connectors connectors = new Connectors(key, secret);
```

## Calling a client

The `Conectors` instance will lazy load the clients, meaning it won't instantiate every client at once but just when needed.
The client is then cached and the same instance is returned every time.

```java
// First call, the client is instantiated.
connectors.market().getServerTime().sync();
// Second call, the same instance is returned.
connectors.market().getBookTicker().sync();
```

## Updating the API keys

Every time you call a client, it will check if its keys are equal to the container keys and update them if not. This feature is really useful if you want to implement a proxy server for multiple users for example.

```java
//Updating keys in the container
connectors.updateKeys(key,secret);
//keys have changed, they are updated in the client when it is called
connectors.spot();
//keys haven't changed, nothing happens
connectors.spot();
```
